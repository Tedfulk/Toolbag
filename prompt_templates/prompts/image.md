1. Golden fluid design

```txt
A highly creative and abstract representation of a brain with golden liquid elements splattered more heavily on the brain itself. The brain appears to be crafted from a smooth, reflective material, while the gold liquid splashes around and through it, creating a dynamic and fluid appearance. The scene emphasizes fluid motion and intricate detail, with the golden liquid adding a sense of luxury and value, possibly symbolizing the precious nature of knowledge and creativity. The overall composition suggests themes of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the merging of organic and artificial elements in a visually striking and thought-provoking manner. The background features a gold pool of water, maintaining the same surreal and imaginative style.
